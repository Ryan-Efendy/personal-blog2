Some have said that love is blind; that when you really love someone, their faults, secrets, and imperfections just seem to evaporate. But is that true love? Scripture reminds us that God is love. He sees all of us, the imperfections, the secrets, the things we hate about ourselves, and still loves us so deeply.  While it's hard to wrap our minds around a God who has always been and who always will be, how refreshing it is to know that He is the great I AM,¬ù and ever-present in our circumstances. Nothing separates, nothing divides, nothing diminishes His love.
<br/>  
He is the great I AM. Thank you, God, for always loving us, taking care of us, forgiving us even when we don't love you back, when we turn away from you. There's no sin, no mistake that will ever surprise God and you still gave your one and only Son away so we can have a right relationship with God. Your love and forgiveness are greater than fear and sin.
