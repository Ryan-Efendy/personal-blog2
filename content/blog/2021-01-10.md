From the garden to the cross, the Gospel is God’s divine rescue plan for us. It’s True Love overcoming all odds and it’s the promise of everlasting life. The Gospel is repentance from our sins, submission to our Creator’s design, and daily dependence on the only One who can change us from the inside out. It's an invitation to follow in the footsteps of the Greatest Servant who ever lived, to be a light in a culture steeped in darkness. Are you all in?  Make no mistake, this is no one-time push of all your chips to the center of the table of life. It is a daily struggle to repent, submit, and depend on the finished work of our Savior. 
<br />  
Yes, Lord, I'm all in! I'm going all in and putting all of my chips of life on Jesus. Lord help me to surrender every part of who I am, not holding back anything, the good and the bad - my relationships, my desires, my finances etc. But is more than just giving things up, is acknowledge Jesus is Lord over my life. Is about submitting to His will and not my will. This is a choice we're confronted each and every day, to live a daily life of dependence, repentance and submission to Jesus and sharing His love with others.
