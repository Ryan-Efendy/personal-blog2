Wassup Jesus,

As I go through my day and my week I will face problems and temptations. But I thank God I'll never have to face them alone. You are *always* with me. You are the best friend I'll ever have. You stick closer than a brother. You walk beside me. ou walk in front of me. You give me comfort & strength. You are within me. You protect & guide me. You provide me with peace. You already overcome all the problems I'll ever face!
