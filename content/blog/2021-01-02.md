God's people hung onto the hope of a coming Savior, one who would subdue the oppressive Roman regime and demand justice. But when the Messiah came, he wasn't who they expected. He didn't come as a conquering King but as a humble servant. He didn't overthrow the Roman government, but encouraged paying taxes to Caesar. He wasn't praised by religious leaders ,but was despised and rejected. He didn't come to save us from our circumstances, but to save us from ourselves.
<br/>  
We can't save ourselves from sin, we can't look to one another, we need someone who is not among us, we need a rescuer, a savior who can save us from the inside out, from our sin. We need Jesus. Jesus is the real superhero! Help and teach us to serve others as you served us. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.
