Dear Lord,

All praise to the Most High! Thank you for waking me up this morning 🌞, and filling my lungs with your breath 🌬️ You ALWAYS provide even amid uncertainty. I don't need to be anxious. I don't need to worry. For peace is dwelling within us. Peace has a name, and His name is Jesus. Let God be God. I pray 🙏 you to help us to let go trying to be in control. I TRUST you, and have FAITH in you to continue to do great things in our life. You're for us!
