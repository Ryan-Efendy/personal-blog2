Yo Jesus,

Thank you for all that you are doing in my life. You know me, you understand me. Thank you for wrapping me in your love that never ever ends! I pray as I go through my day working, talking with friends, school, help me to keep you in my thoughts! I pray I don’t ever replace you for my own selfish gain & desires. Guide me, Lord. Take me on a journey that will change my heart that will see my job differently. My school differently. My friends & family differently. Yes, you have great plans for me, & you will be with me every step of the way! May you receive all the glory & honor with my life. May I stay focused on the things above & not lose sight of who & what I’m living for. YOU. Yes, YOU and YOU alone, Jesus. Love you, Jesus.
