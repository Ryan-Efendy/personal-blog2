Our Creator watched as greed, pride, and lust drove His people to unthinkable depravity. Longing to reconcile us to Himself, God established a guide for us to follow. There was just one problem: He required perfection. Surely, when the Israelites heard this, they must have been outraged. Perfection? We'll never reach that! But, like a beacon of light, the Law exposed the damage we inflicted upon ourselves, revealing the desperation of our state and our undeniable need for a Savior. Yes, we were off course, but there was One coming to reunite us with Our Creator.

The law exposes how far off the mark we are, how sinful we are, and I thank God for helping me come to the end of myself realizing I need help, I need a savior. Thank you for the Gospel Jesus.
