How do we thrive in a society that does not share our beliefs and values? The church in first-century Rome was certainly no stranger to pushback against the Gospel. Early Christians were crucified, fed to wild dogs, and burned at the stake for their faith. Still, the apostle Paul urged fellow believers to obey authority, stay pure, and love God and others. In doing so, Christians served as salt and light, illuminating the path to Christ and His redemption. 

1. Obey authority/figure unless it/they contradict the words of God. God is our ultimate authority.
2. Stay pure, keep Jesus values
3. Trust Jesus - love God and neighbors
