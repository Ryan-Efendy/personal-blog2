Poverty. Racism. Human trafficking. All too often, it seems like the injustices facing our world today drown out the cries for justice. When will oppression, exploitation, and corruption end? We yearn for an impartial judge to set things right.
<br/>  
Yet, at the same time, a just judge is our doom. After all, we are imperfect—and Perfection cannot overlook imperfection. It’s only through God’s great mercy that we have hope
<br/>  
Wow. I'm in awe. Yes our God is a God of justice and a God of mercy. He is just and we're not. Because we're not just, we're not good, we're bad, we're wretched, we're wicked, we're guilty, etc we deserved our punishments and consequences. But Thank God for His great mercy. For His mercy that's brand new each and every day. He paid for our punishment - the Wrath of God and eternal separation and give us a new status, a new standing - His sonship, reborn into his family. I love you Jesus
