Whether we’ve been neglected by a parent or betrayed by a close friend, the feelings of abandonment run deep, leaving bitter memories and painful scars in their wake. Scripture is full of these kind of “left-behind” stories, from Joseph’s brothers selling him into slavery to David’s life-or-death escape from Saul. Yet, even when others fail us, God never will. Even when we reject Him, even when we walk away, even when we fall short, He remains steadfast in His love for us. His great faithfulness covers our greatest failures. In Him, we are never abandoned. 
<br/>  
Great is your faithfulness God! You're faithful when we're not. You love us even when we reject you and love the world. You died the death we deserve. You never leave nor forsake us. In a world that is constantly changing and where people are constantly leaving, whether in a family, relationship or in death, God’s promise of never leaving is encouraging.
