Humanism says that we are masters of our own fate, that we can save ourselves. Religion declares that if we work hard enough, and our good deeds outweigh our bad, we are guaranteed eternal life. But at the heart, humanism and religion are rooted in the same thing -- pride and stubborn self-reliance.  The good news of the gospel is that the work is already done.  Jesus did it.  No matter how much we’re struggling or how much we’ve messed up, no matter how terrible our past or how unforgivable we feel, Jesus paid our debt, and He is the true master of our fate.

Thank God is not by our performance but is all about Jesus performance on the cross. And it's perfect and it is finished -- He lived the perfect/sinless life that we couldn't, died the death we deserve/in our place. Rose from the dead and defeated the final enemy, death. Jesus paid our debt! Thank you, Jesus. We can stop trying harder, doing more, striving, getting better to earn His love, because there's nothing that we can do to make Him love us less. Our response is to love Jesus and rest on the finished work of Jesus.
