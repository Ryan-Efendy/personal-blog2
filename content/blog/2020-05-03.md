Dear Heavenly Father,

THANK YOU for waking me up on this beautiful Sunday morning! You are so so good to me. I thank you in advance for all the things You're going to continue to do in my life. You're always providing, loving, and growing me in unexpected ways. I love it! Prepare me to be ready for what you have for me. Your plans are so much greater than my own. I'm so excited for it! Can't wait! Talk soon!
