Spiritual disciplines are invitations for the Spirit of God to enter an arena where together we will battle against the flesh. The spiritual disciplines I'll be engaging this month are **prayer** and **asceticism**.

## Prayer
#### This will build up a habit of daily prayer.
- I'm committed to praying 🙏 every day once in the morning and once in the evening.

## Asceticism
#### Asceticism is defined as acts of self-denial. Detaching from the things of the world.
#### Help us turn from the things of this world (the desire of the flesh) to God (the desire of the Spirit)
- cold showers 🚿🛀☔️❄️ (max 30 seconds)
- Practice regular, **intense** exercise 🏃
- Get a full night’s sleep (min 7 hours) 😴
- no desserts & sweets 🍰🍦🍮🍧
- Abstain from television, movies, or televised sports.
- Abstain from video games.
- no major material purchases 💰💸💵
- Only use the computer for work, school, or essential tasks (e.g., paying bills).
- Only use mobile devices for essential communications; cut out non-essential texting, app, and internet use.
