We don’t have to travel to a very far to see the hurt and hopelessness that pervades our world today. Brokenness lives in our own backyards. How will our friends, co-workers, and neighbors know the truth of the Gospel message? Jesus invites us to join his rescue team and empowers us to share our story with others. We don't need to have all the answers.  When Jesus healed a blind man in John 9, the man simply said, “I was blind but now I see!” Let’s be faithful to share our story. God’s got the rest.

I love this! Jesus invites us to join his rescue team. Let's answer the call! And we don't have the put all the weight on our shoulder, He's the one who saves (not us) and our job is to simply share our personal story and how it fits in the grand narrative of the gospel!
