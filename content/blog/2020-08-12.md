Father in the name of Jesus, I thank you that your peace is present right now. I pray you to fill me up with Your Spirit, Your will and desire to love You and others. Teach me to be patient and trust in your **perfect** plan -- even when I don't know what's next. I'll put one foot in front of the other and trust you. I'll keep my eyes and mind wide open to all that You are doing in my life. Your power and glory is at work. There's no limit to what I can accomplish when Your Spirit is in me. Humble me and turn me away from my wicked ways.
