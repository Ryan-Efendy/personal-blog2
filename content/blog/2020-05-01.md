Dear Lord,

Thank you for new beginnings. Today I give everything over to you. Thank you for taking away my worries yesterday, so it doesn't steal my joy and peace today. I pray this new month to bring clarity and focus on what you have in store for me. I'll prioritize what's important and not worry about anything I can't control. I'm determined to fix my eyes on you and allow myself to walk at your pace of grace and match my pace of life to Yours.
